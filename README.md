## 1. Overview

This project implements a 4D drone deconfliction system simulating a primary mission and surrounding UAV traffic. The solution leverages a time-scaled 4D KD-Tree to efficiently detect spatiotemporal conflicts and visualizes the airspace dynamically using Plotly's animated 3D graphs.

## 3. Logic and Approach

### 3.1 Mission Representation
The primary mission is a list of 3D waypoints, time-stamped and interpolated into 4D points (x, y, z, t). Simulated drones follow randomly generated trajectories, also interpolated into timestamped 4D paths.

### 3.2 Time-Scaled KD-Tree
To convert time into a compatible spatial dimension, the time component is scaled using:

```python
time_scale = spatial_radius / temporal_tolerance
```

Each point is then represented as:

```
[x, y, z, t √ó time_scale]
```

This allows standard KDTree usage in 4D Euclidean space.

### 3.3 Conflict Detection
Each point of the primary trajectory is queried against the KD-Tree. If any simulated drone appears within the specified spatial and temporal bounds, the conflict is reported. The function stops on the first conflict found.

A modular function is defined for reuse:

```python
def check_conflict_kdtree(...):
    return 'clear' or detailed conflict dictionary
```

## 4. Visualization

- Primary drone path: **blue line**
- Simulated drone paths: **orange points**
- Conflict point: marked with a **cross symbol**, annotated with time and location
- **Play button**: enables real-time animation with contextual annotations

---

## 5. How to Run

### Requirements:
- Google Colab (preferred)
- Python 3.10+
- Libraries: `plotly`, `scikit-learn`

### Steps:
1. Define the primary and simulated drone trajectories.
2. Run the conflict detection function.
3. Animate the result using the provided Plotly visualizer.

---

## 6. Edge Case Handling

The conflict detection correctly handles situations where drones are **spatially close but temporally far apart**. The tolerance is tunable by adjusting the **spatial radius** and **temporal threshold**.

## 7. Sample Conflict Output

```
   Conflict at t = 7.66s
   Primary point #159 ‚Üí [12.771084337349398, 7.771084337349398, 2.16867469879518]
   Collides with Drone 0 at point [13.862254599169832, 7.746677959805442, 1.5897870746212588, 8.044692737430168]

```
